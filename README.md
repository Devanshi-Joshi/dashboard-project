# Dashboard-Project
Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

This is a data science project I did as part of a course on Coursera, where I learnt how to scrap data from the web, clean the data, remove missing values and then visualise the data for it to be interpretted. In this project I have used libraries like Pandas, BeautifulSoup and yfinance. Through this project I was able to implement the theoretical concepts to analyse Revenue Data.
